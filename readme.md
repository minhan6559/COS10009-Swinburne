# Introduction to Programming (COS10009) - Swinburne University

This repository contains all my solutions and projects for the **COS10009 - Introduction to Programming** unit at **Swinburne University**. The unit focused on learning the fundamentals of programming using the **Ruby programming language**. Throughout the course, I completed a series of assignments and two major projects: a **final custom program** and a **research project**.

## Final Result: **100% (Perfect Score)**

I achieved a **perfect final score of 100%**, earning the highest grade for this unit. This repository highlights my work and the skills I developed in Ruby, as well as my application of machine learning concepts, particularly **Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs)**, in a real-world context.

## Repository Contents

- **Weekly Assignment Solutions**: This folder contains my solutions for each weekly exercise, helping me build a solid foundation in programming and problem-solving using Ruby.
- **Final Custom Program - ANNalyze**: This is the final custom program, which allows users to create and train their own neural network to predict hand-written digits.
- **Research Project - Artificial Neural Networks for Handwritten Digit Recognition**: A detailed explanation of the multilayer perceptron concepts used in my ANNalyze program, along with the techniques for detecting hand-written digits in the MNIST dataset.

## Final Projects

### [**ANNalyze**](https://github.com/minhan6559/ANNalyze)
**ANNalyze** is an application that lets you create and train your own neural network to predict hand-written digits. The program utilizes Ruby to implement a **Multilayer Perceptron (MLP)**, a type of artificial neural network. The user can input data, train the model, and test the predictions on their own hand-written digits.

### [**Research Project: Artificial Neural Networks for Handwritten Digit Recognition**](./Custom%20Research%20Project/Artificial_Neural_Network.pdf)
This research project explains the theoretical foundations and practical implementation of **Multilayer Perceptron (MLP)** models, which I used in the **ANNalyze** application. The project discusses how MLPs are applied to the MNIST dataset to recognize hand-written digits, providing insight into neural network training, activation functions, and backpropagation.

## Achievements

- **100% Final Result**: Achieved a perfect score of **100%** for the **COS10009** unit, demonstrating mastery of Ruby programming and foundational programming concepts.
